# Ethical-Web-Scraping-
This code involves building a robust web scraper to collect a curated dataset for film analysis. The core challenge was extracting clean, structured information from a complex website in an efficient and respectful manner.

Key Technical Execution while reviewing this code:

路 Tools & Libraries: Utilized BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and requests for handling HTTP sessions, following Python best practices.
路 Data Handling: Engineered the script to navigate site pagination, systematically extracting film metadata (Title, Year, Rating, Genre) and storing it in a structured format (CSV/JSON).
路 Ethical & Legal Compliance: Prioritized responsible scraping by strictly adhering to the website's robots.txt directives, implementing respectful rate-limiting (time delays between requests), and avoiding any attempt to circumvent paywalls or access non-public data.
路 Robustness: Incorporated error handling for network timeouts and changes in HTML structure to ensure the script's reliability.
